The church is completely autonomous. The congregation is international and represents a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, diverse church family made up of Americans, Mexicans, Europeans, Asians, and people from many other areas of the world.
  </p>
  <p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="_images/sub/sanctuary_sm.jpg" alt="Inside the main auditorium" height="120" width="180" />The Union Church of Monterrey</span> is a warm, caring fellowship that recognizes the diverse needs of an international congregation. With a strong and very colorful history, it can truly be said that the church has ministered to Christians who are now involved in a variety of churches around the world. A committed vision for the future brought the church into existence in 1945. This same vision will see The Union Church progress into the present millennium.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The mission of the church</span> is to bring all people into the saving knowledge of our Lord and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to bind together followers of Jesus Christ for the purpose of sharing in the worship of God, and to make Jesus Christ better known, better loved and better served in all aspects of life throughout the world.
  </p>

These elected leaders form the Church Administrative Board. The Administrative Board is the governing authority and meets monthly to conduct the business of the church. The church has one part-time and two full-time employees other than the pastor: the secretary and two custodians.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Elders</span> are chosen for their exemplary Christian character. They are responsible for the spiritual life of the church. They advise and assist the pastor in spiritual matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Deacons</span> are responsible for the fellowship of the members, care of the sick, visitation of members and prospective members, the charitable and missionary outreach of the church and the use of benevolent funds.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stewards</span> are responsible for the finances of the church, maintenance of church property, and policies with regard to employees other than the pastor.
